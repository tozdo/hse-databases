This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a thrilling event for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that's why I cherish this memory very much\",\n",

So we turned to doing our \"own thing\" at home. However, that just did not work out and our growth was seeming stagnant. Then soon enough, I was only working weekends, so now there was a road blocker yet again to the search. Then, suddenly, I was unable to work due to pregnancy related problems, those conflicts became no more and we visited this church I heard from a family member. When we walked in we had no idea if we were just visiting or if this was going to become our home church. When we walked out, we were blown away by the Lord\\'s presence in that place, the overwhelming welcome and love, and a body of imperfect yet hungry souls uniting with purpose to worship and grow. I feel like God moved the conflicts out of the way in the very best timing. We are beyond happy with the decision we made that day ten weeks ago. Every day we are so grateful for this church. Life is bursting from its seams and we are so joyful thinking about our future with our family in Christ.',\n",
